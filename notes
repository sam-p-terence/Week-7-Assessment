Notes:

Because .unshift() starts at the beginning of an array, it "has to increment all the elements that already present in the Array. push() has to insert an element at the end of the array, so none of the Array elements' index has to change." Source="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12250697/time-complexity-of-unshift-vs-push-in-javascript#:~:text=The%20default%20Complexity%20of%20push,elements'%20index%20has%20to%20change."
Due to this, using the unshift() method takes just a tad bit longer than using the .push() method. Therefore it would be better to use the .push() tool in certain instances.

The larger the number, the longer the result would take to test. hoever the result different between tinyArray and smallArray are a bit strange as the tinyArray did take longer to return a result.
